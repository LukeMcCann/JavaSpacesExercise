This is a demo of the "registerForAvailability" method in the JavaSpace05 specification.

Written by Dr Gary Allen, University of Huddersfield.


The "registerForAvailability" method will accept a collection of templates (rather than a single template) and call the local "notify" method when an object arrives in the space which matches any of those templates.  When calling "notify" it will also provide a copy of the object that caused the notification to fire.


As usual, if using an IDE like eclipse you need to create a java project with the correct classes added as libraries, then paste the code in and run it.  You will also need to edit the run configuration to pass the correct VM arguments.


If running from a command line, set up the classpath with:

	. jinicl

then compile with

	javac *.java

and run with:

	java -Djava.security.policy=policy.all -Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false RegisterForAvailabilityTest


Look at the code, which has extensive comments, to see what is happening.
